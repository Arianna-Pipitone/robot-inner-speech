# robot-inner-speech
A framework to provide Pepper robots with inner speech skill. 
It is based on ACT-R architecture, which is integrated to typical robot's routines, as ROS, text to speech, speech to text.
A pioneristic approach for evaluating how inner speech influences the robot's performances. Inner speech makes the robot transparent, because it becomes able to explain how and what it is doing during task execution. Inner speech opens interesting research outcomes, because it is strictly linked to self-consciousness, it enables high-lebel cognition.
